Setting up your own robot play area

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using `https://github.com/legendac/ToyRobot`
- In your terminal / command prompt, enter the folder directory
- Let's get started!

### Setup

> First, let us get our dependencies ready

```shell
$ npm install
```

### Test

> Now it's time for us to go through the code for the first time. Let's run some tests.
> The npm command has been configured to `mocha test` which will let us run the Mocha testing suite.
> This would cover our unit testing with a few E2E scenarios to make sure everything is OK.

```shell
$ npm test
```

### Play

> Let's see the robot report status after it has gone through its 'mission'!
> The start command has been defaulted to `node index`

```shell
$ npm start
```
